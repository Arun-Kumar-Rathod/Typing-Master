An medium quick brown fox jumps over the medium lazy dog.The medium lazy dog wakes up and bites the medium fox.The medium fox goes "bruh seriously ?".
Scrape the inside of sleep the belly wall.tasting like yoghurt cooked broccoli.its emptiness leaving something,.on the tongue.Escaping the body that wants to quit from the inside.It unlaces you all the tethers sliced away.When I dream of this body ending.of opening the germ of the pain.I am on the side of the road. My hands hold out my stomach my second brain.to the men who already want me to die.
Not marble nor the gilded monuments.Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,.But you shall shine more bright in these contents.Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.When wasteful war shall statues overturn,.And broils root out the work of masonry,.Nor Mars his sword nor war\'s quick fire shall burn.The living record of your memory.
I have not lingered in European monasteries.and discovered among the tall grasses tombs of knights.who fell as beautifully as their ballads tell;.I have not parted the grasses.or purposefully left them thatched.I have not released my mind to wander and wait.in those great distances.between the snowy mountains and the fishermen,.like a moon,.or a shell beneath the moving water.
