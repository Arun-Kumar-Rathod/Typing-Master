I love the feel of wood curls flying off the lathe as I begin to shape the log in front of me.The sound of scraping changes based on the wetness of the wood, the speed at which the lathe is turning, and the type of cut I am making.The smell and feel of wet wood being turned are unique.The water is sprayed out as I cut through the different layers of wood.A log can turn into anything one's imagination can think of with the right set of hands-on tools.I have those hands and imagination.I use all of my senses and intuition to create a beautiful object.That is why I enjoy turning wood.
He ordered his regular breakfast.Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon.He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new.This was also part of the routine.A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all.It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years.

Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate.There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house.I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least.He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency.So I try.
The bowl was filled with fruit.It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices.This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember.Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine.This was a baby step to begin that start.
